# Portfolio Starter (No‑framework)

This is a single‑file portfolio you can deploy to **GitHub Pages** in minutes.

## Quick edit
Open `index.html` and replace:
- `Your Name` with your real name.
- Social links in the “Quick links” section.
- Project cards with your own projects.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a GitHub account if you don’t have one.
2. Make a **public** repository named **`USERNAME.github.io`** (replace USERNAME with your GitHub username, exactly).
3. Upload `index.html` (and optionally `CV.pdf`).
4. Visit `https://USERNAME.github.io` after ~1–2 minutes. If you see 404, wait a bit and refresh.

### Tip: custom repo name
If you prefer another repo name (e.g. `portfolio`), go to **Settings → Pages**, select the `main` branch and `/root` folder, then your site will be at `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME`.

If you want a more advanced site later (blog, publications), migrate to **Hugo Blox Builder** (the system used on the example site) or a React framework. For now, this single file keeps things simple.
