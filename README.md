# 🌿 Mustafa Abdelrahman — Portfolio

This is my personal **portfolio website**, showcasing my background, projects, and research interests in **Computer Engineering** and **Artificial Intelligence**.

The site uses a **dark emerald theme** inspired by modern academic and tech portfolios. It’s entirely built from a **single HTML file** (no frameworks or dependencies).

## 🧩 Features
- Clean emerald green dark theme
- Responsive layout (works on all screens)
- Sections for Bio, Education, Projects, and Contact
- Downloadable CV button
- Fully editable text (open `index.html` and edit directly)

## 🚀 How to view the site
1. Open [https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/portfolio/](https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/portfolio/) in a browser  
   (replace `YOURUSERNAME` with your GitHub username).

2. To run it locally:

## 🛠️ How to edit
Open **index.html** with any text editor (like VS Code or Notepad).
